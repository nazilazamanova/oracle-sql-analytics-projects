### 2. Employee & Order Processing
- Identify which employee handled each order
- Filter orders handled by employees for specific order ranges

**Business Value:**  
Used to analyze employee workload and performance.

### 3. Product & Category Analysis
- List products together with their categories
- Identify products that **have never been purchased**
- Sort products by price (ascending / descending)
- Find:
  - Most expensive product
  - Second most expensive product
  - Cheapest product (using analytic functions)

**Business Value:**  
Supports pricing analysis and product performance evaluation.

### 5. Advanced Customer Spending Analysis
- Identify the customer who spent the most money
- Find the **second highest spending customer**
- Identify the top spending customer **from a specific country (Canada)**

Implemented using:
- JOINs across multiple tables
- Aggregation functions
- `DENSE_RANK()` analytic function

**Business Value:**  
Useful for customer segmentation and VIP customer identification.

---

### 6. Aggregate & Filtering Queries
- Count employees whose last name starts with a specific letter
- Calculate total sum of all product prices

**Business Value:**  
Demonstrates filtering, pattern matching, and aggregation skills.

## Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
- INNER JOIN & LEFT JOIN
- Subqueries
- GROUP BY & HAVING
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX`)
- Analytic functions (`DENSE_RANK`)
- Business-oriented query logic
